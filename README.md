# Simple-Gaming-Optimization
Simple Batch Script that disables useless Tasks and Services while Gaming.
Got tired of these "Game Boosters" that literally do the same shit.

Will not work for everyone without adapting it to the PC (Changing Paths, adding Games, adding Tasks etc.). 

In some Games like Left 4 Dead, Raft and even Cemu Emulator it helped with my fps a lot!
This isn't a Game Changer just simple optimization.
