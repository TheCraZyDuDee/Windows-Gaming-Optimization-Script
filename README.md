# Gaming Optimization Batch Script
Note: There is now a Cloner/Updater you can get it [here](https://github.com/crustySenpai/Gaming-Optimization-Cloner-Updater)

Simple Batch that does optimizations like disabeling Tasks, Services and much more while Gaming.<br/>
All changes will only be temporary you also have the option to revert everything.<br/>
Got tired of these "Game Boosters" that literally do the same shit or even do less.

Here is a list of things that the optimization will do:<br/>

- You can change the Priority from Games to whatever you like
- Killing useless Tasks (Explorer is one of them)
- Disabeling useless Services
- Lower the Priority of some Processes
- Clears the Recycle Bin, Temp Folder and the Prefetch Folder
- Disables HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

It also has a Launcher integrated so you can launch your Games quick and optimize afterwards.

This is meant as a Template so you will need to edit it before use (Changing Paths, adding Games, adding Tasks etc.).<br/>
That also means if there is stuff you don't want to disable or anything else edit it to your liking.<br/>
I just configured it for my use how i need it.

In some Games like Left 4 Dead, Raft, Dead by Daylight and even Cemu Emulator it helped with my fps and lags a lot!<br/>
This isn't a Game Changer just simple optimization so the System will have less work.

Here are my System Specs i use it on:<br/>

- AMD A8 5600k APU (OC on 4.22 GHz)
- 2x8 GB DDR3 1600MHz
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 2GB (Core Clock +230, Memory Clock +650)
- Asus A88XM-A Mainboard
- Windows 10 x64 Pro

Note: There is now a workarround to change the Priority on Games with EasyAntiCheat.
