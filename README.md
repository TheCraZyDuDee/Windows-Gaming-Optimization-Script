# Windows 10/11 Gaming Optimization Batch Script
There is now a Universal Version which has all Features removed that needed to be personalized.<br/>
So you can just use it without editing it much.

Simple Batch that does optimizations like disabeling Tasks, Services and much more while Gaming.<br/>
All changes will only be temporary you also have the option to revert everything.<br/>
Got tired of these "Game Boosters" that literally do the same shit or even do less.

Here is a list of things that the optimization will do:<br/>

- You can change the Priority from Games to whatever you like
- Killing useless Tasks (Explorer is one of them)
- Disabeling useless Services
- Lower the Priority of some Processes
- Clears the Recycle Bin, Temp, Prefetch and SoftwareDistribution Download Folder
- Disables HPET (High Precision Event Timer)
- Changes Powerplan
- Overclocks GPU (if MSI Afterburner is Installed and Profiles are set!)
- Flushes DNS

It also has a Launcher integrated so you can launch your Games quick and optimize afterwards.<br/>
Also it has small Menus like the Tool and App Menu where you can add Programs by editing the Script.

This is meant as a Template so you will need to edit it before use (Changing Paths, adding Games, adding Tasks etc.).<br/>
That also means if there is stuff you don't want to disable or anything else edit it to your liking.<br/>
Currently it obviously is configured to my needs.<br/>
There is a Test Menu you can enter from every select screen when you type test_menu to test things when editing the Script.

In some Games like Left 4 Dead, Raft, Dead by Daylight and even Cemu Emulator it helped with my fps and lags a lot!<br/>
This isn't a Game Changer just simple optimization so the System will have less work.

Here are my System Specs i use it on:<br/>

- AMD A8 5600k APU (OC on 4.2 GHz)
- 2x8 GB DDR3 1600MHz
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 2GB (Core Clock +230, Memory Clock +650)
- Asus A88XM-A Mainboard
- Windows 11 x64 Pro

I also made an 3DMark Test with the Free Version (Test made on Windows 10):

Before:

- Time Spy Score: 2400
- Graphics Score: 2579
- CPU Score: 1725

After:

- Time Spy Score: 2402
- Graphics Score: 2579
- CPU Score: 1731
