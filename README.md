# Simple-Gaming-Optimization
Simple Batch that does optimizations like disabeling Tasks, Services and much more while Gaming.<br/>
All changes will only be temporary you also have the option to revert everything.<br/>
Got tired of these "Game Boosters" that literally do the same shit or even do less.

Here is a list of things that the optimization will do:<br/>

- You can change the Priority from Games to whatever you like
- Killing useless Tasks
- Disabeling useless Services
- Lower the Priority of some Processes
- Clears the Recycle Bin, Temp Folder and the Prefetch Folder
- Disables HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

It also has a Launcher integrated so you can launch your Games quick and optimize afterwards.

Will not work for everyone without adapting it to the PC (Changing Paths, adding Games, adding Tasks etc.).<br/>
That also means if there is stuff you don't want to disable or anything else edit it to your liking.<br/>
I just configured it for my use how i need it.

In some Games like Left 4 Dead, Raft, Dead by Daylight and even Cemu Emulator it helped with my fps and lags a lot!<br/>
This isn't a Game Changer just simple optimization so the CPU, RAM and GPU will have less work.
