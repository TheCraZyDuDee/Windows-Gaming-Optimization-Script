# Simple-Gaming-Optimization
Simple Batch Script that disables useless Tasks and Services while Gaming.
Got tired of these "Game Boosters" that literally do the same shit.

It also is kinda a Game Launcher.

Will not work for everyone without adapting it to the PC (Changing Paths, adding Games, adding Tasks etc.).<br/>
It is intended more as an example and less for general use!

In some Games like Left 4 Dead, Raft and even Cemu Emulator it helped with my fps a lot!
This isn't a Game Changer just simple optimization so the CPU, RAM and GPU will have less work.
